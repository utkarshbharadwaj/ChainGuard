An IoT-powered shipment condition monitoring and decision-support prototype built by **Team Diazonium**.

## 📌 Project Overview

A shipment may arrive at its destination without obvious external damage, while its journey may have included environmental excursions, shocks, or tampering. Traditional tracking answers *"Where is the package?"*

**ChainGuard** is designed to help answer:
*"What happened to the package during the journey, and does its condition warrant inspection?"*

ChainGuard is an IoT-based system that uses a compact ESP32 device traveling inside a shipment to monitor temperature, humidity, acceleration (shock), and enclosure tampering. However, ChainGuard does not simply stream raw sensor values. It features a backend decision engine that processes telemetry into actionable operational decisions.

### From Raw Telemetry to a Decision

The core value of ChainGuard is its data processing pipeline:

```mermaid

    A[RAW TELEMETRY] --> B[EVENT DETECTION];
    B --> C[SEVERITY & DURATION];
    C --> D[CUMULATIVE RISK];
    D --> E[INTEGRITY SCORE];
    E --> F[OPERATIONAL DECISION];
```

## ⚙️ Core Architecture

The complete system flow is: **SENSE → COLLECT → TRANSMIT → PROCESS → EVALUATE → DECIDE**

    S2[Acceleration/Shock] --> ESP32
    S3[Tamper Switch] --> ESP32

    end
```
## 🛠️ Components

### 1. Hardware (IoT Edge)
The prototype uses an ESP32 microcontroller to collect environmental data and transmit it via Wi-Fi.
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32 / ESP32-S3
- **Sensors:** 
  - DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity)
  - MPU6050 (Acceleration/Shock)
  - Reed Switch / Digital Input (Tampering)
- **Firmware:** Located in `hardware/chainguard_esp32.ino`. It polls sensors and POSTs JSON telemetry to the backend API.

### 2. Backend (FastAPI + Decision Engine)
A Python-based backend that handles data ingestion, state management, and the core logic.
- **Framework:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic
- **Database:** SQLite (Stores telemetry, event history, active events, and shipment state)
- **Event Lifecycle:** The `event_detector.py` manages the state machine for environmental excursions. It detects when an abnormal condition begins, tracks its active duration, and logs it when the condition normalizes. Shocks use a frequency/cooldown mechanism to prevent duplicate events.

### 3. Frontend (Live Dashboard)
A lightweight, responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and Chart.js.
- Deployed on Vercel.
- Polls the backend to visualize current decision state, real-time sensor charts, event history timelines, and risk contribution breakdowns.

## 🧠 The Decision Engine

This module (`decision_engine.py`) calculates the shipment's **Integrity Score** and final state based on configurable prototype thresholds and weights.

### Thresholds (MVP Configuration)
*Note: These are configurable prototype values for demonstration, not validated regulatory standards.*

| Parameter | Normal | Severity 1 | Severity 2 | Severity 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature** | 2–8°C | 0–2°C / 8–10°C | -2–0°C / 10–15°C | Other |
| **Humidity** | 30–70% | 20–30% / 70–80% | 10–20% / 80–90% | Other |
| **Shock (m/s²)**| $\le 2.5$ | $\le 4.0$ | $\le 6.0$ | $> 6.0$ |
| **Tamper** | 0 | - | - | 1 |

### Risk Calculation
The engine assigns base weights to different metrics:
- Tamper = 15
- Temperature = 8
- Shock = 7
- Humidity = 3

Risk is calculated dynamically using **duration multipliers** (for sustained temperature/humidity excursions) and **frequency multipliers** (for repeated shocks).

### Integrity Score & Final Decision
The cumulative risk is subtracted from 100 to yield the **Integrity Score**. 

* **ACCEPT** (Score $\ge 80$)
* **INSPECT** (Score $\ge 50$)
* **HIGH RISK** (Score $< 50$)

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The FastAPI backend exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /` - Root status message.
- `GET /health` - API health check.
- `POST /api/telemetry` - Ingests JSON payload from ESP32, updates events, recalculates risk, and returns the new shipment state.
- `GET /api/telemetry/latest/{shipment_id}` - Retrieves the most recent telemetry reading.
- `GET /api/telemetry/{shipment_id}` - Retrieves historical telemetry data.
- `GET /api/events/{shipment_id}` - Lists all completed events for a shipment.
- `GET /api/events/{shipment_id}/active` - Lists currently ongoing condition excursions.
- `GET /api/shipments/{shipment_id}/summary` - Returns a comprehensive view of the shipment's current state, Integrity Score, active events, and recent telemetry.

**Example Telemetry POST Payload:**
```json
{
  "shipment_id": "CG-1042",
  "temperature": 5.4,
  "humidity": 58.0,
  "acceleration": 1.72,
  "tamper_status": 0
}
```
## 💻 Local Setup & Development

   cd ChainGuard
```
2. **Set up the Python Virtual Environment:**
   
```bash
   python -m venv .venv
```
*Activate on Windows PowerShell:*
   
```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
*Activate on macOS/Linux:*
   
```powershell
   source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. **Install Backend Dependencies:**
   
```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Run the Backend Server:**
   
```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The backend will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. API docs are at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

5. **Run the Frontend locally:**
   Open `frontend/index.html` using a local development server (like the VS Code Live Server extension). 
   *Note: To test with a local backend, ensure the `API_BASE` variable in `script.js` points to your `localhost:8000` address instead of the Render deployment.*
